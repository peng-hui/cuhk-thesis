\section{Introduction}
\label{xsym:s:intro}
Web applications have been one of the primary channels connecting service providers and hundreds of millions of end users.
Because of their importance, web applications and their valuable users have been the primary targets of cyber attacks.
A study reported that 64\% of companies had experienced web-based attacks \cite{cyberattack}.
A recent report in 2018 also showed that among 43 popular web applications, each web application on average contained 33 vulnerabilities, and the number of those critical vulnerabilities per web application grew by three times compared to the year of 2017 \cite{webvul}.
