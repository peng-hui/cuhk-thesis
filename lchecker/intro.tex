Comparison is an essential programming feature.
Strongly-typed languages, \eg{}, Python, perform \emph{strict} comparisons that consider both the values and the types of the comparison operands.
In contrast, weakly-typed languages provide the identical and not identical operators (===, !==) for \emph{strict} comparisons, and the equal and not equal operators (==, !=) for \emph{loose} comparisons.
Loose comparisons can implicitly convert the operand types, thus allowing for comparing operands in different types.
